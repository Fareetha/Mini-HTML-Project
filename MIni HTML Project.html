        <p class="red-color-black-bg"> A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.
             Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, 
             but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, 
             including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, 
             to high-priced luxury establishments.

        <p> A good restaurant sets a high standard for its food quality and 
            ensures that guests receive the same quality with every meal.
             Serving quality food can earn your restaurant a good reputation and compel your guests to return for repeat visits.</p>
